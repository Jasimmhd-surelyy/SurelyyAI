# Surelyy-ai
Surelyy is an AI‑ready recommendation engine that helps users find the right recommendations for movies, products, and AI tools based on their preferences and history, instead of random or generic suggestions.

## 🎯 What Surelyy does
Nowadays, many of us experience decision fatigue, spending a lot of time finalizing choices ;either on our own or using AI tools like ChatGPT or Google Gemini. These models usually generate suggestions based on general patterns from their training data, meaning they often recommend what works for most people rather than adapting deeply to an individual’s preferences and behavior.

That’s where Surelyy comes in. Instead of only asking what you need suggestions for, the engine first learns about you through a series of preference-based questions. This allows the system to tailor recommendations to you without needing repeated prompts every time, helping deliver more relevant and personalized suggestions.

## 🎯 Features
- Multi‑category recommendation engine  
  - Supports movies, products, and AI tools as separate sections so users can ask for exactly the kind of recommendation they need.

- Smart question flow  
  - Before giving a recommendation, Surelyy asks simple questions about what the user feels like, their past likes, or constraints (time, mood, budget) to avoid random suggestions.

- Personalized recommendations  
  - Uses each user’s previous answers and activity to avoid repeating the same recs and to move closer to their actual taste over time.

- Recommendation history  
  - Shows a history of what was recommended before, so users can revisit earlier suggestions and see how their preferences evolved.

- Optional vault / saved items  
  - Users can save favourite recommendations or important items into a personal vault for quick access later; the vault is a feature, not the main product.

- Theming and appearance  
  - Light and dark mode options.  
  - Color‑wheel theme picker so users can tune the main accent color to match their preference.

- Clean, minimal UI

## 🎯 How Surelyy was built
Surelyy was built using Lovable to quickly turn the idea into a working product. I focused mainly on designing the user flow, figuring out what inputs actually matter for personalization, and making sure the recommendations feel useful instead of generic.

The system collects user preferences and uses an LLM to help generate recommendations. From there, the app just filters and shows results in a way that is simple and easy to understand.

The main goal while building was not to make something technically complex, but to make something that actually helps people decide faster.
  
## 🎯 Future Direction
Surelyy is planned to expand into more decision categories and improve long-term preference understanding using feedback signals and usage patterns.
